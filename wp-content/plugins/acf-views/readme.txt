== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display fields from user profile, taxonomy term or options page? =

Advanced Views supports all the field sources provided by your chosen meta vendor.

For example, if you're using ACF (Advanced Custom Fields), you can access fields from option pages, user profiles, terms, comments, and menus.

You can refer to the [documentation](https://docs.acfviews.com/getting-started/supported-data-vendors) for the specific list of supported field sources for your meta vendor.

= Can I display fields inside the Gutenberg Query Loop? =

You can use the View shortcode inside the Gutenberg Query Loop element.

Please make sure you've added it via the built-in Shortcode block, as it won't work properly with other block types, like Code or Custom HTML.
